  a person  who must remain nameless  but of whom the lawyer had every reason to think well - a man  in short  of some station in the country - desired to make francis an annual allowance of five hundred pounds  the capital was to be placed under the control of the lawyer's firm and two trustees who must also remain anonymous  there were conditions annexed to this liberality  but he was of opinion that his new client would find nothing either excessive or dishonourable in the terms  and he repeated these two words with emphasis  as though he desired to commit himself to nothing more  francis asked their nature  a walk upon saturday afternoon  an occasional dinner with members of his family  and a yearly tour of a fortnight in the highlands or even on the continent of europe  were his principal distractions  and  he grew rapidly in favour with his superiors  and enjoyed already a salary of nearly two hundred pounds a year  with the prospect of an ultimate advance to almost double that amount  few young men were more contented  few more willing and laborious than francis scrymgeour  sometimes at night  when he had read the daily paper  he would play upon the flute to amuse his father  for whose qualities he entertained a great respect  francis scrymgeour  a clerk in the bank of scotland at edinburgh  had attained the age of twenty-five in a sphere of quiet  creditable  and domestic life  his mother died while he was young  but his father  a man of sense and probity  had given him an excellent education at school  and brought him up at home to orderly and frugal habits  francis  who was of a docile and affectionate disposition  profited by these advantages with zeal  and devoted himself heart and soul to his employment  one day he received a note from a well-known firm of writers to the signet  requesting the favour of an immediate interview with him  the letter was marked private and confidential  and had been addressed to him at the bank  instead of at home - two unusual circumstances which made him obey the summons with the more alacrity  the senior member of the firm  a man of much austerity of manner  made him gravely welcome  requested him to take a seat  and proceeded to explain the matter in hand in the picked expressions of a veteran man of business  the conditions  said the writer to the signet  are  as i have twice remarked  neither dishonourable nor excessive  at the same time i cannot conceal from you that they are most unusual  indeed  the whole case is very much out of our way  and i should certainly have refused it had it not been for the reputation of the gentleman who entrusted it to my care  and  let me add  mr  scrymgeour  the interest i have been led to take in yourself by many complimentary and  i have no doubt  well-deserved reports  they are two  replied the lawyer  only two  and the sum  as you will remember  is five hundred a-year - and unburdened  i forgot to add  unburdened  and the lawyer raised his eyebrows at him with solemn gusto  the first  he resumed  is of remarkable simplicity  you must be in paris by the afternoon of sunday  the 15th  there you will find  at the box-office of the comedie francaise  a ticket for admission taken in your name and waiting you  you are requested to sit out the whole performance in the seat provided  and that is all
