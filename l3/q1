 a fortunate chance and some influence obtained for harry  at the time of his bereavement  the position of private secretary to major-general sir thomas vandeleur  c  b  sir thomas was a man of sixty  loud-spoken  boisterous  and domineering  for some reason  some service the nature of which had been often whispered and repeatedly denied  the rajan of kashgar had presented this officer with the sixth known diamond of the world  at last the general  who was one of the least patient of military commanders  arose from his place in a violent access of passion  and indicated to his secretery that he had no further need for his services  with one of those explanatory gestures which are most rarely employed between gentlemen  the door being unfortunately open  mr  hartley fell downstairs head foremost  for all active and industrious pursuits  harry was unfitted alike by nature and training  he could sing romantic ditties  and accompany himself with discretion on the piano  he was a graceful although a timid cavalier  he had a pronounced taste for chess  and nature had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging exteriors that can well be fancied  blond and pink  with dove's eyes and a gentle smile  he had an air of agreeable tenderness and melancholy  and the most submissive and caressing manners  but when all is said  he was not the man to lead armaments of war  or direct the councils of a state  hurry's duty as secretary was not particularly onerous  but he had a dislike for all prolonged work  it gave him pain to ink his fingers  and the charms of lady vandeleur and her toilettes drew him often from the library to the boudoir  he had the prettiest ways among women  could talk fashions with enjoyment  and was never more happy than when criticising a shade of ribbon  or running on an errand to the milliner's  in short  sir thomas's correspondence fell into pitiful arrears  and my lady had another lady's maid  the gift transformed general vandeleur from a poor into a wealthy man  from an obscure and unpopular soldier into one of the lions of london society  the possessor of the rajah's diamond was welcome in the most exclusive circles  and he had found a lady  young  beautiful  and well-born  who was willing to call the diamond hers even at the price of marriage with sir thomas vandeleur  it was commonly said at the time that  as like draws to like  one jewel had attracted another  certainly lady vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest water in her own person  but she showed herself to the world in very costly setting  and she was considered by many respectable authoritues  as one among the three or four best dressed women in england  up to the age of sixteen  at a private school and afterwards at one of those great institutions for which england is justly famous  mr  harry hartley had received the ordinary education of a gentleman  at that period  he manifested a remarkable distaste for study  and his only surviving parent being both weak and ignorant  he was permitted thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of pretty and purely elegant accomplishments  two years later  he was left an orphan and almost a beggar
